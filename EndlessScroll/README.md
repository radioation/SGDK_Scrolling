# Endless Scroll Image Generation Script

`sgdk_endless_scroll.py` is a simple Python script that creates endless
scrolling images for use with Sega Genesis / SGDK.  You must supply at least
one 16-color indexed image to be warped into a repeating floor pattern.  The
generated image can optionally have a ceiling pattern.  The ceiling  can use
the same image as the floor or a separate image can supplied for the ceiling
pattern.

## TODO
The script has some rough edges, but does what I needed it to.  There are 
some obvious things that could be improved:

* Check input values for invalid combinations
* Blend pixels at edges of warp pattern (or sample images instead of 
  using OpenCV's warp)
* Generate code with user configurable scrolling step sizes 
* Generate code with lookup tables for scrolling values

I'll likely add code to check input values and handle odd numbers, but this
script is very low priority.  I may never get around to the rest of it.


## Dependencies
The script was written for [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and requires 
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [PILLOW](https://python-pillow.org/), and 
[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

I'm using WSL and Ubuntu 22.02 on my development machine, but I imagine 
most people will be using Windows.  I'm going to keep on using WSL, but 
I have installed the windows versions to test the script. 
1. Get Python3. I used the Microsoft Store version.

2. Install the dependencies.  I opened a command line window and typed:
```cmd
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install jinja2
```
3. Run the script with:
```cmd
python3 sgdk_endless_scroll.py
```

# Examples
## Floor with two near repetitions and four far repetitions
The default behavior is to take an input image named "image.png" and repeated
it twice at the bottom row of the image (row 223) and four times at the top of
the floor pattern (row 80).  Type 
```bash 
python3 sgdk_endless_scroll.py 
```
This generates an image called `bg.png` and should  output text similar to the
following
```cmd
Scroll width far: 80.000
Scroll width near: 160.000
Starting row floor: 180
Ending row floor: 223
* Scroll increment floor: 0.0233
* Final Scroll increment floor: 1.8605
Image size 480 x 224
```
![default background](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radioation/SGDK_Scrolling/main/EndlessScroll/bg.png)
The output gives you information you can use to scroll the image.
* Scroll width far 80.000 : The repeated image takes up 80 pixels at the top row of the floor.
* Scroll width near 160.000 : The repeated image takes up 160 pixels at the bottom row of the floor.
* Starting row floor 180 : The floor starts at row 180 in the output image
* Ending row floor 223 : The floor ends at row 223 in the output image
* Scroll increment floor 0.0233  :  The amount each successive scroll line should increase if you're scrolling the top row by one pixel.
* Final Scroll increment floor 1.8605 : The amount each floor row differs by before the scroll values needs to be reset.
* Image size 480 x 224 : The size of the output image.



If you want the floor rows to scroll right to left, you'd move row 80 left
by one pixel, row 81 left by 1.0233 pixels, row 81 by 1.0466, pixels, and so
on.  
```c
  ++scrollStep;
  fix32 fStep = FIX32(1.0);
  for( u16 row=180; row<224; ++row ) {
    fscroll[row] = fscroll[row] - fStep; // shift row left
    fStep =  fStep + FIX32(0.0233);        // change shift by 0.0233 pixels
  }
```
This works up to 80 pixels for the top row.  This is because the output image
only has enough pixles drawn to scroll one repetition.  To handle this, reset
the scroll values when the top row has moved 80 pixels.  
```c
    scrollStep = 0;
    memset(fscroll, 0, sizeof(fscroll)); // zero out all scroll values
```
Put together:
```c
static scrollLeftLoop() {
  ++scrollStep;
  fix32 fStep = FIX32(1.0);
  if (scrollStep < 80) {
    for( u16 row=180; row<224; ++row ) {
      fscroll[row] =  fscroll[row] - fStep;
      fStep =  fStep + FIX32(0.0233);
    }
  } else {
    scrollStep = 0;
    memset(fscroll, 0, sizeof(fscroll));
  }
}
```

Scrolling the floor left to right is similar. The main difference is you
move the rows in the opposite direction.  Row 80 moves to the right by one
pixel, row 81 right by 1.0233 pixels, row 81 by 1.0466, pixels, etc.
```c
  --scrollStep;
  fix32 fStep = FIX32(1.0);
  for (u16 row = 180; row < 224; ++row)
  {
    fscroll[row] = fscroll[row] + fStep;
    fStep = fStep + FIX32(0.0233);
  }
```
Again, this only works up to 80 pixels for the top row.  Resetting the scroll
lines is a bit more complex here.  You have to put all of the lines at their
Final scroll position. This can be computed with the 'final scroll increment'
value output from the script.  In this case:

`* Final Scroll increment floor: 1.8605`

```c
    scrollStep = 80;
    fix32 scroll = FIX32(-80.0);  // scrolled by 80.
    for (u16 row = 180; row < 224; ++row)
    {
      fscroll[row] = scroll;
      scroll = scroll - FIX32(1.8605); // decrement by final value
    }
```
Put together:
```c
static scrollRightLoop()
{
  --scrollStep;
  fix32 fStep = FIX32(1.0);
  if (scrollStep >= 0)
  {
    for (u16 row = 180; row < 224; ++row)
    {
      fscroll[row] = fscroll[row] + fStep;
      fStep = fStep + FIX32(0.0233);
    }
  }
  else
  {
    scrollStep = 80;             
    fix32 scroll = FIX32(-80.0); 
    for (u16 row = 180; row < 224; ++row)
    {
      fscroll[row] = scroll;
      scroll = scroll - FIX32(1.8605);
    }
  }
}
```

## Floor with four near repetitions and 6 far repetitions
You can increase the number of image repetitions with the `-f` and `-n`
parameters.  To have six repetitions at the far side of the floor and four
repetitions at the near side run these parameters:
```bash
python3 sgdk_endless_scroll.py -i test_tile.png   -f 6 -n 4  -o tilefloor.png
```
I also specified a different floor image with the `-i` parameter and changed the 
output filename with `-o`.

## Add a ceiling
Adding a ceiling can be done by specifying the start (`-S`) and end (`-E`) rows for the ceiling.
```bash
python3 sgdk_endless_scroll.py -i test_wood.png   -f 6 -n 4   -S 8 -E 48 -o woodceil.png
```
![Wood Ceiling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radioation/SGDK_Scrolling/main/EndlessScroll/woodceil.png)
## Add a ceiling with its own tile images
Specifying `-I` lets you add a second image for the ceiling.
```bash
python3 sgdk_endless_scroll.py -i test_wood.png   -f 6 -n 4   -S 8 -E 48  -I test_tile.png  -o woodfloor_tileceiling.png
```

## Create an example project
Specifying a folder with the `-p` parameter will create a project folder with files for SGDK.
If your environment is setup correctly, the project files can be built with:
```cmd
 %GDK%\bin\make -f %GDK%\makefile.gen
```
